**hardcodes** is a utility for searching strings hardcoded by developers in programs. It uses a modular tokenizer that can handle comments, any number of backslashes & nearly any syntax you throw at it.

Yes, it is designed to process any syntax and following languages are officially supported:

```
ada, applescript, c, c#, c++, coldfusion, golang, haskell, html, java, javascript,
jsp, lua, pascal, perl, php, powershell, python, ruby, scala, sql, swift, xml
```

#### Installation

##### with pip

```
pip3 install hardcodes
```
##### or build from source

```
git clone https://github.com/s0md3v/hardcodes && cd hardcodes && python3 setup.py install
```

### Documentation

hardcodes is available as both a library as well as a command line program. The relevant documentation can be found below:

- [For developers](https://github.com/s0md3v/hardcodes#for-developers)
- [For users](https://github.com/s0md3v/hardcodes#for-users)

### For Developers

The sample program below demonstrates usage of `hardcodes` library

```python
from hardcodes import search

string = "console.log('hello there')"
result = search(string, lang="common", comments="parse")
print(result)
```

```python
Output: ['hello there']
```

The arguments `lang` and `comments` are optional. Their use is explained below in the user documentation section.

### For Users

`cli.py` provides a grep-like command line interface to `hardcodes` library. You will need to install the library first to use it.

#### Find strings in a file

```bash
python cli.py /path/to/file.ext
```

#### Find strings in a directory, recursively

```bash
python cli.py -r /path/to/dir
```

#### Hide paths from output

```bash
python cli.py -o /path/to/file.ext
```

#### Specify programming language

Specifying a language is optional and should be used only when the programming language of source is already known.

```bash
python cli.py -l 'golang' /path/to/file.go
```

#### Specify comment behaviour

With `-c` option, you can specify

- `ignore` ignore the comments completely
- `parse`  parse the comments like code
- `string` add comments to list of hardcoded strings

`python cli.py -o /path/to/file.ext`

#### Specify line numbers

With the `-n`, `--line-numbers` option, you can attach the line numbers where 
string occurred. This can be used to locate the line in code easily, or to
use as input into a script that will modify the strings for you.

The line numbers are inserted between the file name, and string, also using ':'
as a seperator. (See 'filter' example below).

#### Filter output by regular expression

With the `-q`, `--query` option, the output can be filtered by applying a
regular expression (supplied on the command line) to the extracted string.

This can be used for specific tasks, such as changing all occurances of a 
product's name, or publisher.

```bash
python cli.py -l python -n -q "source code" cli.py
```

which gives the following output:

```
cli.py:12:specify programming language of source code
cli.py:13:include source code line numbers in output
```
